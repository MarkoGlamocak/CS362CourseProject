# CS362CourseProject
 Marko Glamocak and Luka Djogo Course Project For CS 362

 ### Progress Updates
 ##### November 3
 ###### Luka

 Today I will be looking into how we will solve the problem of identifying a ball from a webcam. Questions I will try to resolve:

     - How can we unpack photos using an arduino that isn't computationally demanding? 
     - Is there a library that can be used?
     - What algorithm will we then use?
     - What math will we need to map camera space to real world space?
     - We will have two actions the car can do: move forward and adjust.
