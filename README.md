# CS362CourseProject
 Marko Glamocak and Luka Djogo Course Project For CS 362

### Question Categories
##### Webcam Ball Identification
     1. How can we unpack photos using an arduino that isn't computationally demanding? 
     2. Is there a library that can be used?
     3. What algorithm will we then use?
     4. What math will we need to map camera space to real world space?
     5. We will have two actions the car can do: move forward and adjust.

##### Car Construction
     1. How are we going to collect tennis balls?
     2. How can we move the car forward a certain amount of meters?
     3. How can we progragramtically and mechanically make the car turn a certain amount of degrees.
     
### Progress Updates
##### Webcam Ball Identification

##### Car Construction
     1. The car will push a funnel with a hinged flap at the entrance. When the ball hits the hinged flap it will only be able to enter, rolling into a container    
        where the balls collected will be able to be extracted easily. The funnel will be constructed out of plastic due to the lightness of the material.
 2 & 3.
